<h1>MY FAVORITE CARS</h1>
<p>My favorite cars</p>
<p>Hello, my favorite car is HONDA, SUPRA, BMW,</p>
<p>Honda didn't even finish school,
  at the age of 16 he went to an auto repair workshop in Tokyo as an apprentice.
  At an early age,his great interest in cars was caused by his father,
  he was a blacksmith who repaired e-bikes,
  while teaching his son to solve various problems.
  After collecting enough money in 1928,
  Honda returned to his hometown in Hamamatsu Province and opened his first repair shop there.</p>

<p>Starting in 1986,
  the Supra was separated from the Celica,
  after which it became a separate model.
  In this regard,
  Toyota stopped using the prefix Celica and the name of the car became simply Supra.
  The first,
  second and third generations of Supra were produced at the Tahara plant,
  and the fourth generation at Toyota.
  The Supra is related to the Toyota 2000GT,
  from which it received the M-series Toyota engine.
  The Toyota Supra has appeared in many movies,
  video games,
  music videos,
  and television shows.</p>

<p>July 21,
  1917 is considered the official date of establishment of the company,
  however,
  the history of "Beemve"
  began several years earlier.
  In 1913,
  two small firms appeared in Munich,
  headed by Karl Rapp and Gustav Otto (the son of Nikolaus Otto, who created the internal combustion engine).
  These two companies were forced to merge during the First World War and began to produce aircraft engines.
  In 1916,
  the company changed its name to "Bairische Motoren Werke".
  In 1917,
  the "Beemve"
  emblem was also developed - the symbol of a rotating propeller.
  In the same year,
  the chief engineer of the company,
  Max Fritz,
  created a 6-cylinder aviation engine - Tour-3A,
  and then - Motor-4,
  with which Franz Diemer set a world record in high jump in 1919,
  when he climbed 9,670 meters into the sky.</p>
